# Experience Documentation

## Tool Selection Justification

For this assignment, I chose an AI-powered vibe coding tool to build my project because it offers a more conversational and context-aware development experience compared to traditional coding environments. Instead of writing every line of code manually, the tool allowed me to describe what I wanted to build in natural language and receive a working solution quickly.

This approach was particularly appealing for a small project like a Todo List application, as it enabled fast setup and rapid prototyping. Using a vibe coding tool helped me focus more on understanding the project logic and requirements rather than spending time on boilerplate code.

## Development Process

During the development process, I interacted with the AI tool by providing clear prompts that described the desired features of the application. These included adding tasks, deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, and storing data persistently using localStorage. The AI generated the initial structure of the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It took a few iterations to refine the generated output and ensure that the application behaved correctly. Testing the application in the browser and refreshing the page helped verify that the data persistence feature worked as expected. Overall, the tool significantly reduced development time compared to building everything from scratch.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges I faced was understanding the structure and flow of the generated code. Since parts of the code were created automatically, it was necessary to carefully review each section to understand how different components interacted with one another.

In some cases, I had to manually adjust small parts of the code to improve readability and ensure correct functionality. The AI tool was helpful in resolving issues, but human review and debugging were still necessary to produce a clean and working final result.

## Reflection

This experience showed me that vibe coding tools are powerful for rapid development and prototyping, especially for small to medium-sized projects. They can significantly speed up the development process and lower the barrier to entry for building functional applications.

However, the project also demonstrated that understanding the underlying code is still essential. While AI tools can assist developers, they should be used as supportive tools rather than replacements for core programming knowledge. In the future, I would use vibe coding tools alongside manual coding to achieve both speed and deeper understanding.
