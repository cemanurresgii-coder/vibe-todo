# Comparative Analysis

During this assignment, different approaches were considered to develop a Todo List web application.

Initially, online platforms such as Replit and AI-based web editors were tested. Although these tools provided fast setup and ready-made interfaces, managing project files and understanding the underlying structure was confusing.

Later, developing the project locally using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provided better control and clarity. Debugging became easier and the learning process was more effective.

This comparison showed that while AI tools can speed up prototyping, building a project manually improves fundamental understanding.
